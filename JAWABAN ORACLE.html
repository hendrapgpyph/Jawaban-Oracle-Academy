	Because the interpreter tries to read the method but when it finds the method you intended to use it crashes.		
	This will not give you an exception, it will give you an error when the program is compiled. (*)

	Because the interpreter tries to read the method but when it finds the method you intended to use it crashes.		
	This will not give you an exception, it will give you an error when the program is compiled. (*)

49. 	Which of the following would be most beneficial for this scenario?

Joe is a college student who has a tendency to lose his books. Replacing them is getting costly. In an attempt to get organized, Joe wants to create a program that will store his textbooks in one group of books, but he wants to make each book type the subject of the book (i.e. MathBook is a book). How could he store these different subject books into a single array?

	By ignoring the subject type and initializing all the book as objects of type Book.		
	By overriding the methods of Book.		
	Using polymorphism. (*)		
	This is not possible. Joe must find another way to collect the books.

	A way to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

8. A computer company has one million dollars to give as a bonus to the employees, and they wish to distribute it evenly amongst them. 

The company writes a program to calculate the amount each employee receives, given the number of employees.

Unfortunately, the employees all went on strike before they heard about the bonus. This means that the company has zero employees.

What will happen to the program if the company enters 0 into the employment number?	
�	An unfixable error will occur.
�	The program will calculate that each employee will receive zero dollars because there are zero employees.
�	An exception will occur because it is not possible to divide by zero. (*)
�	The programmers will have proven their worth in the company because without them the company wrote faulty code.

	Mark for Review 
(1) Points
					
			
	It would print the array backwards. The console screen would display: 42 11 64 215 18 0
	
			
	It would print the array one element at a time. The console screen would display: 0 18 215 64 11 42
	
			
	It would print the string returned from the method. The console screen would display: [0,18,215,64,11,42,] (*)
	
			
	It would print the string returned from the method. The console screen would display: {0, 18, 215, 64, 11, 42}
	
					
				
[Correct] 		Correct
	
					
		2. 	Why would a programmer use polymorphism rather than sticking to a standard array? 	Mark for Review 
(1) Points
					
			
	Because arrays are more complex and polymorphism simplifies them by restricting them to only contain the same type objects.
	
			
	Because it is easier to add or remove objects using polymorphism even when all of the objects are of the same type.
	
			
	A programmer wouldn't use polymorphism over a standard array.
	
			
	Because arrays only work using the same object type and polymorphism provides a way around this. (*)
	
					
				
[Correct] 		Correct
	
					
		3. 	Is there a difference between overriding a method and overloading a method? 	Mark for Review 
(1) Points
					
			
	Yes. Overriding is done within a single class and overloading is done through a series of superclasses and their subclasses.
	
			
	No, they are the same.
	
			
	Yes. Overriding is done in the subclass and allows for redefining a method inherited from the superclass and overloading is done within a class and allows for multiple methods with the same name. (*)
	
			
	Yes. Overriding allows for the creation of an array of different object types and overloading restricts an array to only contain the same object types.

		13. 	Suppose you are writing a program where the user is prompted to the give coordinates where they believe the princess is inside of the castle.

Your program moves the prince to the coordinates that the user specified. If the princess is not found at those coordinates, the user is given a clue that helps them guess coordinates closer to the princess. The user is allowed to enter their new guess of where the princess is. 

Assume your program does not take into consideration the possibility that the user may enter coordinates outside of the castle where the princess could not be. What would be the result of the user entering coordinates outside of the castle? How could this be handled in your code?	 Mark for Review 
(1) Points
					
			(Choose all correct answers)	
					
			
	An exception would occur. This could be handled by throwing the exception in your code if the user enters invalid coordinates. When the exception is caught, the prince could be moved to the coordinate inside the castle that is closest to those that the user specified. (*)

			
	An exception would occur but could not be handled inside your code. The user would have to restart the program and enter proper coordinates.

			
	An error would occur. Errors cannot be handled by code.

			
	An exception would occur. This could be handled by throwing an exception in your code if the user enters invalid coordinates. When the exception is caught, the user could be prompted to enter coordinates within the given range of the castle. (*)

	Because the interpreter does not recognize this method since it was never initialized, the correct spelling of the method was initialized.

			
	Because the interpreter tries to read the method but when it finds the method you intended to use it crashes.

			
	Because the parameters of the method were not met.
